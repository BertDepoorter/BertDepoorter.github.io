Announcements and news can be much longer than just quick inline posts. In fact, they can have all the features available for the standard blog posts. See below.

In this first post, I will tell you more about the project I am working on at the moment: my master thesis at the ITF, KU Leuven. I am working on EMRI systems, which are extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. 


#### EMRI properties

<ul>
    <li>Strong gravity regime</li>
    <li>Many inspiral orbits: very long signals</li>
    <li>Emit GWs in LISA band</li>
    <li>Rich spectrum of waveforms</li>
</ul>

I am mostly concerned with generating these waveforms. We have set up a GPU-accelerated code which allows fast calculation of the waveform by interpolation over a grid of precomputed data points. Next up we will check the accuracy of this model against some surrogate PN5 AAK models. Another thing we want to check is how this code behaves when pushed towards the comparable-mass regime. This we will do by comparing waveforms of the SXS collaboration against those generated using FEW.
