Hello there!  

Welcome to my personal page. Allow me to introduce myself: Currently, I am a master student at KU Leuven specializing in theoretical and computational physics. Scientifically, I have a broad interest. My research interests lie in gravitational wave physics, mostly in simulation and data analysis. This is also the field I'm most familiar with. Besides, I am interested in climate physics, cosmology, statistical physics, monte carlo methods. I am fascinated by physics nont just by a passion to understand nature, but also for its broad range of applications and methods it has to offer in the study of complex systems. Be it economics, biology, neuroscience, urban development, climate change and solutions, engineering, ... almost all fields have profited from interactions with theoretical physics. 

More in general I enjoy reading, both literature and infromative books about history, science, sociology, philosophy, ... Besides, I like the outdoors, hiking, cycling, and maintaining an active, healthy lifestyle. Mens sana in corpore sane. 


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
